                <h3>The Project</h3>
                <p class="lead">Who is Bob?</p>
                <p>Wilhelm "Bobnut" DeKokosnoot (aka Bob) is a chat bot that uses natural language processing and machine learning to respond to the contextual polarity of the messages in a chatroom. Bob appears as any other user to chatroom participants. In order to do this, a client socket had to be built to send and receive messages using the Internet Chat Relay (IRC) protocol. All messages received through the socket are sent to Bob who sorts them and sends the appropriate output back.</p>
                <p class="lead">Statistical Classification</p>
                <p>Programmed in Python, Bob uses a machine learning classifier to determine his response. A classifier is a system that can predict, based on training input, the classification or category of previously unknown input. In this project, when you type a message in the chatroom, Bob uses his classifier to determine the sentiment category (whether the message is "positive" or "negative") even though he has likely never seen your message before. The training input used in this classifier is a corpus of movie reviews provided by Cornell University that are categorized as either positive or negative. The first classifier used was the naive Bayes which produced a 60% accuracy rate. This means that Bob could accurately determine the sentiment of your chatroom message 60% of the time. Interestingly enough, studies show that humans are only accurate at determining sentiment 80% of the time. Bob is currently running a Fisher classifier with 65% accuracy so he's well on his way to matching the accuracy of a human being!</p>
                <p>To see how the classifiers compare to each other, please see <a class="nav" href="{{ url_for('classifiers') }}">this page</a>.</p>
                <p class="lead">Preprocessing<p>
                <p>To determine the category of a chatroom message, the classifier first extracts the meaningful features from the text. In machine learning, a feature is a property of the categories being classified. This project uses words as features, but it's quite possible to use any measureable property, for instance, length of a sentence or punctuation. In order to extract the words from the text, considerable pre-processing had to be done to strip other data, such as email addresses and numbers, from the sentences. In addition, stopwords, words with little or no semantic value, had to be removed.</p>
                <p>Once the features are extracted, the classifiers go to work.</p>
                <p class="lead">The Website</p>
                <p>The website you are on is running on Flask, deployed on Heroku, and is monitored by New Relic analytics. Its clean, modern look was designed using the Kube CSS framework as well as custom elements. </p> 
                <p class="lead">Chat with Bob</p>
                <p>To chat with Bob, visit <a class="nav" href="{{ url_for('chat') }}">the chat page</a>. The chat client you will be using is powered by KiwiIRC. Choose an available nickname and click "start". Bob will be there to greet you and you can begin chatting with him. As you send Bob messages, he will respond to their sentiment. Bob loves a good knock knock joke. Be sure to tell him one or two while chatting.</p>
                <p class="lead">Next Steps</p>
                <p>The wonderful thing about Bob is that he's so darn flexible. The possibilities of where to take Bob next are endless. One area of concern is the classification accuracy. Looking further into pre-processing and feature selection is a great next step. Treating synonyms as one term, stemming, and dealing with pivot words (such as "not" and "despite") are all examples of pre-processing techniques that could be done to increase Bob's accuracy. In addition, it could be worth exploring a linear regression classifier.</p>
