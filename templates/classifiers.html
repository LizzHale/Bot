                <h3>About the Classifiers</h3>
                <p class="lead">What is a classifier?</p>
                <p>A classifier is a system that can predict, based on training input, the classification or category of previously unknown input. In this project, when you type a message in the chatroom, Bob, the IRC bot, uses his classifier to determine the sentiment category (whether the message is "positive" or "negative") even though he has likely never seen your message before. The training input used in this classifier is a corpus of movie reviews categorized as either positive or negative. The first classifier used was the naive Bayes which produced a 60% accuracy rate. This means that Bob could accurately determine the sentiment of your chatroom message 60% of the time. Interestingly enough, studies show that humans are only accurate at determining sentiment 80% of the time. Bob is currently running a Fisher classifier with 65% accuracy so he's well on his way to human perfection!</p>
                <p>To determine the category of a chatroom message, the classifier first extracts the meaningful features from the text. In machine learning, a feature is a property of the categories being classified. This project uses words as features, but it's quite possible to use any measureable property, for instance, length of a sentence or punctuation. In order to extract the words from the text, considerable pre-processing had to be done to strip other data, such as email addresses and numbers, from the sentences. In addition, stopwords, words with little or no semantic value, had to be removed.</p>
                <p>Once the features are extracted, the classifiers go to work.</p>
                <p class="lead">The naive Bayes classifier</p>
                <p>The naive Bayes classifier is a probabilitistic classifier that assumes that the value of a feature is unrelated to the presence or absence of any other feature, meaning that it looks at each feature in isolation to determine the category. Since language does not behave in this way, the naive Bayes classifier can become confused when, say, dealing with negation. For example, phrases like "not amazing" will be difficult for the naive Bayes to deal with.  
                <p class="lead">The Fisher classifier</p>
                <p>Unlike the naive Bayes, the Fisher classifier takes into account the other features present in the input to arrive at a classification. Its process is much like the naive Bayes but it goes one step further by looking at the probability that the combination of the features would appear in a particular category. This can help to offset an outlying feature, for instance, if there is one very positive word in an otherwise negative sentence.</p>
